<h2 id="event-types">Event Types</h2>


The DOM Event Model allows a DOM implementation to support multiple modules of
events. The model has been designed to allow addition of new event modules in
the future. This document does not attempt to define all possible events. For
purposes of interoperability, the DOM defines a module of user interface events
including lower level device dependent events and a module of document mutation
events.
